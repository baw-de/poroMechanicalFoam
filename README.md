# poroMechanicalFoam
poroMechanicalFoam is an extension to OpenFOAM and solids4Foam, designed to model porous flow and deformation coupled problems in porous media. It can handle entrapped gas bubbles and partial saturation through SWCC curves and advanced mechanical constitutive models for the porous skeleton deformation.
## Features
- Integration with solids4foam for solid mechanics calculations
- Handling of partial saturation with modern computational methods
- Flexibility for adjusting to specific needs
- Close alignment with OpenFOAM's solid mechanics developments
## Prerequisites
- OpenFOAM v2306
- solids4Foam 2.1
## Installation
1. Ensure you have the prerequisites installed.
2. Source OpenFOAM.
3. Export the environment variable `s4fPath` with the path to your solids4foam installation folder:
```
export s4fPath=/path/to/solids4foam
```
4. Navigate to the poroMechanicalFoam installation folder.
5. Run the compilation script:
```
./Allwmake
```
